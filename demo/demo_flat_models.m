%demo for running and testing 'flat' models, i.e. models which are
%completely specified by their spike-count distribution.

%% Scenario 1: Sample from different flat DG models with same mean but different 
% correlation coefficients, and compare their rasters and
% count-distributions

%% Scenario 2: Compare these models to Ising model


%% Scenario 3: Calculate entropy of these models as a function of population
% size, and compare to asymptotic results
