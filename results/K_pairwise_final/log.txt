This folder contains the core results for the study on 'correlations and criticality' by Nonnenmacher et al.

To compute specific heat traces from the K-pairwise maximum entropy model for neuronal populations of different size n, 
we completed a four-step procedure: 

1. We randomly subsampled the full simulated RGC recording at n = 10, 20, ..., 300
2. We generated feature moments E[f(x)] for spiking data x for 50 such random subpopulations at each population size n = 10,20,...,300.
3. We fitted K-pairwise models to the feature moments for the *first* 10 random subpopulations at population size n = 20,40,...,120.
4. We estimated specific heat traces at different temperatures from the 10 fitted K-pairwise models at population sizes n = 20,40,...,120

The results of our computations are stored in 

1. idxSubsamples.mat
2. Efx_xyz.mat          | 'xyz' is 'nat' for natural stimuli
3. lambda_xyz.mat       |          'cb' for checkerboard stimuli
4. heat_traces_xyx.mat  |          'fff' for full-field flicker 

Indexing is meant to be coherent between these files, i.e. 
idxSubamples is       a 30x1 cell       (30 population sizes at 10 increment) of nx50 index matrices
Efx_xyz gives         a 30x1 cell       (30 population sizes at 10 increment) of mx50 feature value matrices (m=n*(n+3)/2+1)
lambda_xyz gives      a 12x1 cell       ( 6 population sizes at 20 increment) of mx10 fitted parameter value matrices
heat_traces_xyz gives a 12x10x31 matrix ( 6 population sizes at 20 increment, 10 random subpopulations, 31 temperatures) 
 
The suffix '_lin' specifies 
1. neuron IDs, 2. population statistics, 3. model parameters, 4. specific heat_traces 
obtained for subpopulations of fixed sizes that were sampled with a spatially structured scheme (linearly from one side of the simulated retina patch to the other).
